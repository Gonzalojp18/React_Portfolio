# React_Portfolio
This is my first project using react as library of js. I'm creating a new portfolio where I want to show new project and new tool and technologies. 

Id create a single page of my portfolio where I'm showing a simple menu of navigation with five item and also I use the canva library 
from to show an basic 3d animation, this portfolio is 100% responsive - 
I Learned and used a bit of styled components, used the media query library and also give them some of style in file. 
I could improve some of the media query, for example using inside a variable and then could use in any another elements. 

Next Steps: 
First: 
I will create a new file, I mean new component, from to about me section and make up to me wich background gonna use because its gonna depende of the front size gonna use to write 
the text inside this section, maybe talk a little about me, my experiencia or any hobbie, my goal and aspirations of life. 
I want tu put one background text with medion font size and one opacity in the word FRONT END; in this section I gonna add one Icon with dark mode. 

Second: 
I will create the section skill&tech where I'm gonna talk about each tools or any kind of tecnhology that I've been learning during the last months.
Im sure to used a library of animations. 

Third: 
In this part I will create the section blog, where i want to write a bit about my road learning for example: 
tips
recomendation of pague or any other type of material from to use

Finally to create the contact section where i gonna make an basic form using other library.
